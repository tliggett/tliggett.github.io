                <p>At Rosemount I coached youth football for the Rosemount Area Athletic Association (RAAA) for six years. Coaching is an intense passion for me and I have enjoyed every minute of my coaching experience. Coaching is a way for me to make an impact on my community as well as on myself.</p>
                <p>I coached hundreds of young athletes over my time with RAAA, and it has been a blessing to work with every one of them. As a varsity player, and before that just an older player, I was able to relate with the kids in a way adult coaches couldn't. One day at practice, I taught my players the new defensive coverage I was installing with a reference to Madden, the top football video game played by football fans of all ages. The kids never forgot that concept.</p>
                <p>What I love most about coaching are the great sports moments I can help create. Sports moments occur at all levels, whether it be the Helmet Catch in the Super Bowl or a player's first tackle in 3rd grade football. These moments teach better than anything I have ever experienced. Through the game winners, the tough losses, and everything in between, we learn key lessons about effort, dedication, and teamwork. </p>
                <h3>2016: Rosemount 7th Grade Gold Defensive Coordinator</h3>
                <p>During my senior year of high school, I drastically increased my role with the team by becoming the defensive coordinator for a team of 7th graders. My work consisted of writing a defensive playbook, planning out and executing the defensive part of practice, and teaching players both fundamentals and minutiae of the game. In addition to a playbook, I developed a gameplan each week to combat the opposing team's strengths. I can honestly say coaching that team was one of the best experiences of my life.</p>

                <p>TJ has had a very powerful  and impactful impression on my son Carter throughout his early football experience.  He not only coached and helped his Dad with  practices, but I think TJ made a stronger impression on how he showed these boys what dedication and determination can get you.  We followed TJ throughout his middle school and high school seasons, and for a smaller guy in the early years, TJ continued to work hard and show his "team first" approach which landed him a starter and key contributor in his Junior and Senior years.  His hard work in the weight room and on the field of practice continued to make a strong impression on Carter.  Last year, Carter wasn't allowed to carry the ball or catch the ball due to his size, so he was not as interested in playing.  I used TJ as an example of what a team needs to win on all levels, and told him that he could still make a significant difference on and off the field.  The results....Carter's team went on to play in the Championship game, and he was given the Pat Tillman award as a team leader.

                <p>Our son, Samuel (age 13), thoroughly enjoyed working with TJ and came to know him as a truly valuable coach.  He was dedicated to his players, dependable, flexible and incredibly hardworking.  Beyond that, he was an impressive roll model who demonstrated outstanding academic success in the classroom and sportsmanship as the Captain of the Varsity Rosemount High School football team.  Our family was proud to cheer him on in the stands and share, “He is our coach!” with others.</p>
                <p>His knowledge of football and expertise in defensive plays was a huge advantage to our team.   He put this skillset to work in order to advance our team’s skills in a manner that they could learn and have fun at the same time.  Many hours were spent developing defensive plays outside of practice and games with each player in mind.   During games, he was always engaged on the sidelines cheering and offering advice to the players.  This made an impact on our son’s confidence and drive when playing.</p>
                <p>Along with his undeniable talent, TJ has been an absolute joy to get to know. He is a true team player who always manages to foster positive discussions and bring out the best in others.</p>
