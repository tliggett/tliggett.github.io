					<h3>Super Sim Football</h3>
					<p>My first true coding expedition, and one of my favorite, was to create a football simulator. The simulator takes players through a game of football in which they are the coach. By calling plays, players can gain yards, move the chains, and score touchdowns. Many obstacles, such as fumbles and interceptions, will come their way.</p>
